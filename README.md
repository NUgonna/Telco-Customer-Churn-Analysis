## Revenue and Customer Churn Analysis
### Goal: 
The client wants to improve customer retention by identifying high-value customers and churn risks. This project was able to explore this issue by using data to answer important questions and provide recommendations based on the insights. Before using the data for analysis, the dataset was cleaned.


### About the data: 
This is real business data of a Telecommunication company in California for Q2 2022 (The company has been kept anonymous). The data was provided publicly by Maven Analytics (https://www.mavenanalytics.io/data-playground). It is a Telecom Churn Dataset consisting of 2 tables. The first table is the Customer churn table which provides details of a customer demographic, location, subscription service, how long the customer has stayed with this company etc. and the second table (Zip Code Population).
